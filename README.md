# KR_C

This repository contains my solutions and exercises for "The C Programming Language" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie (K&R). It's a collection of code and notes as I work through the book. It also contains various algorithms like search, sorting, graphs, etc. It also contains few CS50 C codes. 

## About

- **Author**: Jason Pandian (aka JSN)
- **GitHub**: [pandiajason](https://github.com/pandiajason)
- **Email**: pandiajason@gmail.com

## Progress

I'm currently working through the K&R book and C concepts. I will continue to update this repository as I progress further.

## Usage

- Code files are named descriptively (e.g., `01_hello.c`).
- You can compile and run the code using a C compiler like GCC. For example:
  ```shell
  gcc -o 01_hello.out 01_hello.c '&&' ./01_hello.out
