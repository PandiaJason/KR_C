# KR_C

This repository contains my solutions and exercises for "The C Programming Language" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie (K&R). It's a collection of code and notes as I work through the book.

## About

- **Author**: Jason Pandian (aka JSN)
- **GitHub**: [pandiajason](https://github.com/pandiajason)
- **Email**: pandiajason@gmail.com

## Progress

I'm currently working through the book and have completed exercises up to Chapter 1.15. I will continue to update this repository as I progress further.

## Usage

- Each chapter may have its own folder (e.g., `chapter1`) containing relevant code and exercises.
- Code files are named descriptively (e.g., `hello_world.c`).
- You can compile and run the code using a C compiler like GCC. For example:
  ```shell
  gcc -o hello_world.out hello_world.c
  ./hello_world.out
